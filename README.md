# Security
I'm new to Git. I'm also into security docs, and programs. I'm using this repo as a place to collect security resoucrse I find around git.
Maybe upload some I'v found elsewhere. If you know a good resource that would be good for me to add, please do so. I'm not sure what the 
best way tto do this is. Again, I've set this repo up to learn more about how to use this place. Git looks like an awesome resource and 
I can't wait to become profcient around here. Please offer suggestions should you come across this READ me.
